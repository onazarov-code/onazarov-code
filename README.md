### 🧑‍🎨 About Me  
Hi, I’m Orzu — a passionate Graphic & Visual Designer who believes that design is more than decoration; it’s a language that speaks without words.

I’m currently studying Design and Media, learning how to combine creativity, storytelling, and technology to bring ideas to life. My journey started with a curiosity for colors and shapes, and now it’s grown into a love for building clean, smart, and emotionally engaging visuals.

My design style is simple yet meaningful — I like clarity, balance, and strong visual identity. I’m always experimenting with typography, color theory, and layout composition to create designs that connect with people.

Beyond design, I enjoy exploring digital branding, UI/UX principles, and how design can make online experiences feel human and intuitive.

When I’m not designing, you’ll probably find me:
